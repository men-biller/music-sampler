                <p style="color: #e8b19c;">
                    Aphex Twin, otherwise known as Richard D. James, is a groundbreaking electronic artist from
                    Cornwall, England.
                    He is widely regarded as one of the most innovative and influential figures in electronic music.
                </p>
                <p style="color: #e8b19c;">
                    Starting from humble beginnings, James released his first album under the Aphex Twin name as a ‘best
                    hits’
                    compilation, which led to confusion among listeners since it was his debut album. However, shortly
                    after its
                    release, it was met with critical acclaim and quickly became cemented in the hallways of iconic
                    cerebral electronic
                    giants like Mort Garson, Autechre, Mu-Ziq, and many more. But James was just getting started.
                </p>
                <p style="color: #e8b19c;">
                    The next album, <em>Selected Ambient Works Vol. II</em>, aimed to be the opposite of his debut.
                    Instead of
                    syncopated drum machine chaos, <em>SAW II</em> explored the ambience of electronic music, featuring
                    the wistful
                    nature of blooming synths and shuddering drums that felt muffled and less prominent than in his
                    previous work.
                </p>
                <p style="color: #e8b19c;">
                    In 1996, Aphex Twin released another critically acclaimed album, this one created mostly with
                    digital software,
                    including GarageBand and other computer-based tools. Unsurprisingly, this album was also widely
                    praised for being
                    exploratory and radically different from his earlier work. By this point, James had released four
                    albums that most
                    electronic enthusiasts consider to be some of the best electronic music ever made. Yet, Richard was
                    far from finished.
                </p>
                <p style="color: #e8b19c;">
                    In 2001, James accidentally left an MP3 player full of unreleased music on a plane, and he quickly
                    assumed the music
                    would be released online unless he did it first. <em>Drukqs</em> became another masterful electronic
                    album, which
                    includes one of his most well-known songs, "Avril 14th"—a solemn piano melody that doesn’t even
                    sound like something
                    he composed due to its calm, grounded nature in contrast to his usual work.
                </p>
                <p style="color: #e8b19c;">
                    Aphex Twin would go on to release two more full albums: <em>Syro</em> in 2014 and <em>Computer
                        Controlled Acoustic
                        Instruments Pt. 2</em> in 2015. <em>Syro</em> earned a Grammy for Best Electronic Album, while
                    the latter project
                    captivated music lovers due to its unique nature: every sound and note was created by a programmed
                    robot playing the
                    instrument live. To my knowledge, no one fully understands how James undertook this task, but he
                    did.
                </p>
                <p style="color: #e8b19c;">
                    Ultimately, Aphex Twin remains a fundamental influence on numerous artists today. For example, C418,
                    the composer of
                    the original <em>Minecraft</em> soundtracks, was heavily inspired by James’ work. If you ever find
                    yourself listening
                    to electronica that sounds too good to be true, chances are Richard’s shadow lies somewhere in the
                    inspiration and
                    creation of that song.
